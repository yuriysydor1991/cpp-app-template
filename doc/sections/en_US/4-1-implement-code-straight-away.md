## Implement code straight away!

To proceed the application implementation right away look for the `main.cpp` file which is designed to accept initial code of the application. Specifically, new code may be placed into the `int main(int argc, char** argv)` free function.

**But do not forget about the SOLID principles and code decomposing!**

It's preferable to create other directories which would contain implemented components of the application and include them into the `main.cpp` file implementation, rather than put all the code inside the `main` function itself.
