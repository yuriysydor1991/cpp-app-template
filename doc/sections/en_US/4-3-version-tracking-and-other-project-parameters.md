## Version tracking and other project parameters

The project's `CMakeLists.txt` files are tracking of a current project git repository commit, project name, configure date and projects version that are forwarded into the projects's configure header file located at `src/app/project-global-decls.h.in`. The `project-global-decls.h.in` will be compiled into the build directory as `project-global-decls.h`. The `ApplicationVersionPrinter` class includes this project's configure file and uses the information provided to print appropriate version info. Usually, this code is executed by calling generated executable with a `-v` or `--version` command line flag. After the version is printed, the default implementation cause the application's `ApplicationVersionPrinter` instance to return zero value and cause the executable to stop it's execution.
