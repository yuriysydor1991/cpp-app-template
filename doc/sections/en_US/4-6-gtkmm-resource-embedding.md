## Resource embedding

To avoid any install and run dependencies any file registered as a resource are embedding into the binary. Resource embedding is performed through the `src/gtkmm3/ui/template.gresource.xml` GResource file resources of which are compiled into the C-resource by a `glib-compile-resources` command. Register new and remove old resources in the `src/gtkmm3/ui/template.gresource.xml` file in order to make them available in the binary executable. The examples of the resource obtaining and usage in the C++ code side may be examined in the default implementation of the `GtkmmWindow` class.
