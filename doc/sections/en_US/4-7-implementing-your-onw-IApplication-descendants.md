## Implement your own IApplication descendants

You may implement another custom `IApplication` descendant classes in order to support high level variety of the application behavior to not to mess original `Application` class with irrelevant `if`-s statements and mixing up code (remember about the SOLID's single responsibility principle).

You may accomplish `IApplication` subclassing by directly creating an `IApplication` subclass in a new file or extend existing `IApplication` descendant like `Application`, `ApplicationHelpPrinter` or a `ApplicationVersionPrinter`.

Register newly created custom `IApplication` descendant in the `ApplicationFactory`'s `create_application` method which is responsible to create appropriate application instance with accordance of a provided data through the command line parameters.

That may be accomplished by implementing a custom `ApplicationFactory` descendant and overriding it's create methods like `create_application` and/or others (call appropriate static member in the `main` function of the `main.cpp` file).
