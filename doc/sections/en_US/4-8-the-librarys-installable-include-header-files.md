The [src/lib/facade/public](src/lib/facade/public) directory contains installable public include header files. Public header files are defining implemented library main facade interface for the underlying functionality. Introduce new classes and/or methods to share more functionality amongst any project of interest. The contents of the [src/lib/facade/public](src/lib/facade/public) will be installed for example under the default `include/CppAppTemplate-0` (in accordance of the project name and it's major version) sub-directory with respect of specified prefixed root install directory.

Alongside successful installation of the library's binary and header files there will be installed appropriate CMake-module to ensure library visibility for the external projects requiring it. Examine the [src/lib/cmake/lib-cmake-module-gen.cmake](src/lib/cmake/lib-cmake-module-gen.cmake) and [src/lib/cmake/TemplateLibraryConfig.cmake.in](src/lib/cmake/TemplateLibraryConfig.cmake.in) CMake files for details on the library project CMake module.
