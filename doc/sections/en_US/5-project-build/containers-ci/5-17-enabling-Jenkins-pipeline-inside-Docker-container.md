## Enabling Jenkins pipeline inside Docker container

In order to enable the [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) pipeline execution inside the Docker container build and start the appropriate container with image by building the `jenkins-pipeline-docker-run` target:

```
# Inside the source root directory

# Configuring the project to support Docker with Jenkins targets
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_DOCKER=ON -DENABLE_JENKINS_DOCKER_PIPELINE=ON

# Building and starting Jenkins' pipeline Docker container
# or restarting it
cmake --build build --target jenkins-pipeline-docker-run
```

Locate and save the new generated password for the [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) Web GUI in the log output that may look like next:

```

Jenkins initial setup is required. An admin user has been created and a password generated.

Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (port may change) address with the help of prefered Web browser. Process to finilize the installation of the [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) system with the help of it's GUI.

After successfull installation and configuration of the [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) create appropriate pipeline for the project inside the [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) Web GUI panel.

All the [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) pipeline CMake build scripts are located at [cmake/enablers/dockerers/template-project-docker-Jenkins-pipeline-runner-target.cmake](/cmake/enablers/dockerers/template-project-docker-Jenkins-pipeline-runner-target.cmake) file. The pipeline script located at [misc/Jenkinsfile](/misc/Jenkinsfile) which should be specified in the pipeline source script at the [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) Web GUI pipelines configuration page. The [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) Web GUI Docker container port may be changed by specifying a new value for the `JENKINS_PIPELINES_PANEL_HTTP_PORT` CMake variable.

The [cmake/enablers/dockerers/template-project-docker-Jenkins-pipeline-runner-target.cmake](/cmake/enablers/dockerers/template-project-docker-Jenkins-pipeline-runner-target.cmake) CMake script for the template project [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) pipeline Docker container builder by default will restart previously built contianer if target build launched repeatedly.

### Starter scripts

The [scripts/docker](/scripts/docker) directory holds the shortcuts which perform both commands above, so the whole run takes a single command:

| Script | Starts the CMake target |
| --- | --- |
| [jenkins-run.sh](/scripts/docker/jenkins-run.sh) | `jenkins-pipeline-docker-run` |
| [jenkins-build.sh](/scripts/docker/jenkins-build.sh) | `jenkins-pipeline-docker-build` |

```
# inside the project root directory

scripts/docker/jenkins-run.sh
```

Each of them configures the `build/release` directory with both the `ENABLE_DOCKER` and the `ENABLE_JENKINS_DOCKER_PIPELINE` options set to `ON` and then builds the target of interest, so no `docker` command of its own is ever issued. The `jenkins-pipeline-docker-run` CMake target depends on the `jenkins-pipeline-docker-build` one, which means the [jenkins-run.sh](/scripts/docker/jenkins-run.sh) script builds the image as well and the [jenkins-build.sh](/scripts/docker/jenkins-build.sh) one is only needed to build the image without starting the interactive container.

The scripts accept the very same parameters as the [Quick build scripts](/doc/sections/en_US/5-project-build/5-36-quick-build-scripts.md) ones, since they are their callers:

```
# inside the project root directory

# changes the Jenkins Web GUI port of the container
scripts/docker/jenkins-run.sh -DJENKINS_PIPELINES_PANEL_HTTP_PORT=9090
```

Whether the already built image and the already created container are reused or rebuilt is decided by the CMake script at the configure step, so the `--no-reconfigure` parameter keeps the decision of the previous configure run.
