### Starting the generated executable

If executable compiles and is present in the build directory start it in the terminal with path found from a previous subsection by a command:

```
# from the build dir
./src/CppAppTemplate
```

Once again, the `CppAppTemplate` is the **default** name of the project. Replace it with our own custom one if it was changed in the project's root `CMakeLists.txt` file (the `PROJECT_NAME` and/or `PROJECT_BINARY_NAME` variable).
