# enabled, then the `package` target of that build.
#
# The `package` target runs the preinstall step, which builds the project, so
# no separate build step is performed.

# Every parameter of the release-configure.sh and the release-build.sh scripts
# is accepted and forwarded, so an own -D<variable>=<value> override wins over
# the ENABLE_WIX one below.
